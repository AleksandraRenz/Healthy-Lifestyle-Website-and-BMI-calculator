        <h2>1. Lunges</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Challenging your balance is an essential part of a well-rounded exercise routine. Lunges do just that, promoting functional movement, while also increasing strength in your legs and glutes.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
<li>Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms down at your sides.</li>
<br>
<li>Take a step forward with your right leg and bend your right knee as you do so, stopping when your thigh is parallel to the ground. Ensure that your right knee doesn’t extend past your right foot.</li>
<br>
<li>Push up off your right foot and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. This is one rep.</li>
<br>
<li>Complete 10 reps for 3 sets.</li>
</ol>

      <h2>2. Pushups</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Drop and give me 20! Pushups are one of the most basic, yet effective, body weight moves you can perform because of the number of muscles that are recruited to perform them.</p>
      <br>
      <ol>
<li>Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral.</li>
<br>
<li>Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor. When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows and return to the start. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement.</li>
<br>
<li>Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible.</li>
</ol>

      <h2>3. Squats</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Squats increase lower body and core strength, as well as flexibility in your lower back and hips. Because they engage some of the largest muscles in the body, they also pack a major punch in terms of calories burned.</p>
      <br>
      <ol>
<li>Start by standing straight, with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your arms at your sides.</li>
<br>
<li>Brace your core and, keeping your chest and chin up, push your hips back and bend your knees as if you’re going to sit in a chair.</li>
<br>
<li>Ensuring your knees don’t bow inward or outward, drop down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, bringing your arms out in front of you in a comfortable position. Pause for one second, then extend your legs and return to the starting position.</li>
<br>
<li>Complete 3 sets of 20 reps.</li>
</ol>

      <h2>4. Standing overhead dumbbell presses</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Compound exercises, which utilize multiple joints and muscles, are perfect for busy bees as they work several parts of your body at once. A standing overhead press isn’t only one of the best exercises you can do for your shoulders, but it also engages your upper back and core.
      <br>
      <b>Equipment:</b>10-pound dumbbells</p>
      <ol>
<li>Pick a light set of dumbbells — we recommend 10 pounds to start — and start by standing, either with your feet shoulder-width apart or staggered. Move the weights overhead so your upper arms are parallel to the floor.</li>
<br>
<li>Bracing your core, begin to push up until your arms are fully extended above your head. Keep your head and neck stationary.B</li>
<br>
<li>After a brief pause, bend your elbows and lower the weight back down until your triceps muscle is parallel to the floor again.</li>
<br>
<li>Complete 3 sets of 12 reps.</li>
</ol>
<br>

      <h2>5. Dumbbell rows</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Not only will these make your back look killer in that dress, but dumbbell rows are also another compound exercise that strengthens multiple muscles in your upper body. Choose a moderate-weight dumbbell and ensure that you’re squeezing at the top of the movement.
      <br>
      <b>Equipment:</b>10-pound dumbbells</p>
      <ol>
<li>Start with a dumbbell in each hand. We recommend no more than 10 pounds for beginners.</li>
<br>
<li>Bend forward at the waist so your back is at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Be certain not to arch your back. Let your arms hang straight down. Ensure your neck is in line with your back and your core is engaged.</li>
<br>
<li>Starting with your right arm, bend your elbow and pull the weight straight up toward your chest, making sure to engage your lat, and stopping just below your chest.</li>
<br>
<li>Return to the starting position and repeat with the left arm. This is one rep. Repeat 10 times for 3 sets.</li>
</ol>
