			<p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</p>

			<h1 class="justify-content-center">Main Food Groups</h1><br>
			<p>A well balanced diet is the key to maintaining good health and wellbeing. It consists of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.  You don’t need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category. You need to eat smart! This means eating various kinds of food from each of the main food groups and in the right proportion sizes.</p>

				<h2>It's Important To Know</h2>
				<p>It's important to get some fat in your diet, but foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar have been placed outside of the circular image as they're not necessary as part of a healthy, balanced diet and most of us need to cut down on these.

				Unsaturated fats from plant sources (for example, vegetable oil or olive oil) are healthier types of fat.

				But all types of fat are high in energy (calories), so they should only be eaten in small amounts.

				On average, women should have around 2,000 calories a day and men should have around 2,500 calories a day.

				Find out how food labels can help you choose between foods and pick those lower in calories, fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt.</p>
