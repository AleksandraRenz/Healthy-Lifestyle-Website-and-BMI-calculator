				<h2>Quinoa Breakfast Cookies</h2>
                <br>
				<p>Breakfast cookies? It can't get any better than this we've told ourselves coming across this recipe.
                <br>
                <br>    
                Some people don't seem to agree with the statement that the breakfast is the most important meal because they always says they don't need it. With the busy schedule that we use to have nowadays and our love for sweets I knew that those cookies are our chance to improve our day. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Cooking them on weekend, frozing the batch, and having them ready to go nice and fresh each morning during the workday will give us nutrition end energy to start the day. They've got all the goods: quinoa, oat flour, carrots, flaxseed, almond butter (you can also use peanut butter), maple syrup (also good with agave syrup or honey for non vegans), nuts and cranberries (we've used goji berries for even more benefits). Try it, I promise - you won't regret.

				<h2>Tabbouleh Salad</h2>
                <br>
				<p>Tabbouleh is one of our favourite salads. Very easy to make, the whole process of making it is really just chopping veggies. It's full of herbs like mint and parsley mixed with zest of lemon juice, just lovely. It originates from Lebanon and you can make in with bulgur wheat, but also with cous cous or quinoa. Watch below one of the examples of how to prepare it.

				<h2>Caponata</h2>
                <br>
				<p>Sicilian Caponata is to die for. You can eat it warm or cold, with potatoes, baguette or even on a sandwich. If you like olives and aubergine, you're going to love it. It can be main dish, or an appetiser/relish made of mentioned veggies but also tomatoes, capes and celery sticks. We love its savoury and sweet flavour and rich texture.

				<h2>Dahl</h2>
                <br>
				<p>You can eat this indian spicy, nutritious soup, as a sauce, like this in a more condensed way, or as a warming, spicy soup, great for the wintertime. Red lentil is the base of the dish making it rich in protein. It's packed with oriental flavours thanks to turmeric, cumin seeds, cinnamon and cloves. Turmeric is acommpanied by coconut milk, therefore you can benefit from curcumin that acts anti-inflammatory while in fats. We like to eat it with naan bread and humus.
